	This package contains classes for the handling of Mac OS X main menu Application events, 
	like About and Quit.<br>
	Since these classes use Mac-only libraries they are compiled and jarred on a Mac and the jar
	is added to the classpath of relevant targets/projects.<br>
	Since it is derirable to have a repository sourcetree that compiles as a whole 
	(e.g. a "build all" in a ide) on any system, the java files are renamed to txt files.
	There is a separate ant build file that can and should be called from the main ant build file.
