        This is a simple recognizer that illustrates the basic communication with ELAN.
        The only thing this demo recognizer does is creating a segmentation based on a user
        definable constant interval. By default in the first seconds of the file, but if there 
        are example selections provided by the user, the interval in which to create segments is
        based on the extent of all selections.
