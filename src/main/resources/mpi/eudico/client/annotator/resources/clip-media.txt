#
# This is an example media clipping configuration file for use with ELAN.
# The configuration consists of the name of an application that can clip 
# media files and that supports parameterized calls from the command line 
# followed by a number of parameters for the application.
# The actual set of parameters depends on the application of choice. 
# But most programs will need the path to an input file, the path to an output file,
# the begin time of the portion to clip and either the end time or the duration of 
# the portion to clip.
#
# When creating a clip from within ELAN, it reads the script and fills the 
# placeholders for the common parameters with the necessary information. 
#
# The first part of the script should be the name or the path to the application
# to be used for the clipping. If only a name is used the application should be
# known to the system, "in the path". If a path is specified it should be the 
# absolute path to the application. If the absolute path contains white spaces the
# path should be within double quotation marks. If the input file and output file
# paths might contain spaces and the clipping application would need them to
# be in quotation marks these should be added before and after the pladeholders 
# in the script.in
#
#
# The placeholders have this form:
#
# $in_file
# $out_file
# $begin(format)
# $end(format)
# $duration(format)
#
# where format needs to be replaced by one of the following formats:
#
# hour:min:sec.ms
# hour:min:sec:fr
# hour:min:sec:fr_NTSC
# sec.ms
# ms
# fr
# fr_NTSC
#
# when frames are specified PAL is assumed, for NTSC use hour:min:sec:fr_NTSC or fr_NTSC
#
# Examples:
# 
# C:\Program\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss $begin(sec.ms) -t "$duration(sec.ms)" -i $in_file $out_file
# M2-edit-cl /in:$begin(fr) /out:$end(fr) $in_file $out_file
